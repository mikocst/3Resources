# THREE JS RESOURCE LIST

As a creative developer who loves 3D, I thought it would be cool to create a website that talks about three JS and resources I've found. I also want to link people's
Twitters to who I think you should follow if you want to dive into three JS or 3D in general.

This project is actually inspired by Huy Nguyen's pillarstack website! I thought it would be a cool opportunity to take what I've learned in three js journey and the 
other front-end practice and try to make a single page website.

Check out Huy's work and Youtube Channel!
